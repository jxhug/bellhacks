# EcoTransit

EcoTransit is a very broken website that calculates the difference in carbon emmisions between driving and walking to a point from your location. It uses shadcn-svelte, SvelteKit, and Mapbox. It also has apis for Wolfram Alpha and Carbon Interface to calculate the carbon emmisions, but because towards the end of the hackathon we got CORS errors, we did it on-device instead. It got Best for the Environment track at BellHacks 2024.
